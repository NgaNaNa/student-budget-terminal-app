## Software Development Plan for the Student Budget Terminal application

### Statement of purpose and scope for your application:

- What the application does:
    - This terminal application is called Student Budgeting App. It is designed to support students in managing their finances in a quick and handy format. Simple to understand and simple to use. It will hopefully help students gain some freedom when they have control over their weekly expenditures.
    How it works: The app will present users with a series of questions to gain data. Using the data, the app will perform mathematical calculations and generate outputs that are relevant to the user. Inside the app, there will be a variety of preset templates of financial recommendations. Based on the outcome of the mathematical calculations, the app will be able to evaluate which recommendations are suited to the user, using methods and logic in its program.

- The problem it will solve and why I am developing it:
    - I wanted to build this app to help young adults who are new to navigating their finance independently. This app will allow them to be active thinkers of where they are putting their monies, and that where they put their monies will alter their daily life. Hopefully, this app will prevent young people from falling into debt, and that living within their means is a doable thing. The app will be able to do basic math calculations, evaluate and give meaningful and helpful recommendations about their financial situation for that week. Weekly use of the app and practicing the recommendations should help keep user on track with their spending and savings.

- Identify target audience:
    - The target audience would be anyone who has either a regular income or weekly income that varies. The same user would also have weekly expenses that they are responsible for. This app would be ideal to anyone from 16 years of age and above, and has access to a computer. The internet is required only at the start for installation.
    It is targeted towards anyone who wants to spend small amount of time working out their financial situation and break down for that week. Someone who would to have a general forecast every week about how they spend their money.

- How the target audience should use the app:
    - The user would be presented with a series of questions and they need to answer it using the keyboard input. The program collects and store the data, then presents it to the user to confirm if their entry is correct. If correct, the program proceeds to the next feature where it evaluates the data and presents the user with a recommendation based on their inputs. The recommendation is a reflection and provides simple financial advise to the user.
    An extra feature, which is extra, is to present the user with a list of things they can purchase with the money they have saved. The list would be items that may be of interest to students often on a budget.

### List of features in the application.

#### Feature No. 1
- The first feature in this app will allow for data input from the user's keyboard. The program will store this data for later use. This part of the feature happens when the app starts, it will go straight to presenting the user with a series of questions as part of its flow structure. See example below:
```
What is your expected income this week?
250
```
